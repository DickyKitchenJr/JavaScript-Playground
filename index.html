                <summary>Why This Was Built</summary>
                <p>While building out my first landing and portfolio pages, I included a three color linear gradient background.<br>
                As I researched various color combinations, I would occasionally experiment with different colors just to see the result.<br>
                That gave me the idea to build a project that randomly assigns Hue/Saturation/Lightness (HSL) values and displays the combinations both in text and its color gradient on the background of the page.<br>
                The combinations will sometimes produce beatiful displays, while other times creating a muddled mess (hence the reset button).<br>
                By providing the HSL values, users can duplicate the display on their own.</p>

                <p>I'd love to have some deep thoughtful reason for building this, but this was all about fun.<br>
                I often sit around with friends and family trading cheesy jokes, and we often find ourselves searching the interet for new ones.<br>
                So really, it was only logical that I built my own joke randomizer that pulls from an array of jokes.<br>

                <p>In addition to being a developer, I'm also an author of fictional books.<br>
                Because of this, I've come across many other authors and writers, including many fantasy writers.<br>
                Despite not writing in the fantasy genre, I've always found it interesting how unique some of the characters names can be.<br>
                That made me question what makes a name a name, which led me to this project.<br>
                I wanted to create a project that would randomly display something akin to a name that met the following criteria:
                <ul>
                    <li>A length of between 2 and 9 letters</li>
                    <li>First letter capitalized</li>
                    <li>Vowels limited to 2 next to each other</li>
                    <li>Consonants next to each other must form a digraph</li>
                </ul>
                The problem solving aspect of this was the real draw for me to create this project.</p>
